        Einstein, a German physicist, is best known for his theory of relativity
        and specifically mass–energy equivalence, expressed by the equation E =
        mc2. Einstein received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics “for his services
        to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of
        the photoelectric effect.

        Tesla was a Serbian engineer and inventor who is often described as the
        most important scientist and inventor of the modern age, a man who “shed
        light over the face of Earth”. He is best known for many revolutionary
        contributions in the field of electricity and magnetism in the late 19th
        and early 20th centuries.
